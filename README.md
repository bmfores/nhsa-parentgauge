# National Head Start Association - Parent Gauge Data Analysis

This repository contains the code and documentation for conducting a comprehensive data analysis of interviews collected through the Parent Gauge tool by the National Head Start Association (NHSA). Parent Gauge is designed to help Head Start programs assess and improve parent engagement strategies. It is a web-based tool that assists programs in understanding parents' experiences and perceptions regarding their involvement. Through a series of questions, the tool measures how well programs foster positive relationships with parents, including supporting families in achieving their goals and creating a solid educational foundation for children. The analysis aims to understand and gain insights into the experiences of parents who have participated in Head Start programs.

## Overview

The NHSAâ€™s Parent Gauge tool has collected a rich dataset through years of interviews with parents. This dataset includes quantitative and qualitative information ranging from survey responses to open-ended interview questions. This project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and advanced analytical techniques to derive meaningful insights from the data.

## Repository Structure

- data_cleaning/: Directory containing scripts and notebooks used for cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
exploratory_data_analysis/: Directory containing scripts and notebooks used for exploratory data analysis.
 data_quality/: tbd
- main_analysis: tbd
- advanced_analysis/: Directory containing scripts and notebooks that apply advanced analytical techniques such as natural language processing and machine learning.
- .gitignore: A file containing patterns that match files or directories that Git should ignore.
- README.md: The file you are currently reading.
- NOTE: This repository does not include the actual dataset for privacy and security reasons.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- Python: The primary programming language used for data analysis.
- Pandas: A powerful Python data analysis library.
- Jupyter Notebook: An open-source application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.
- Tableau: For dashboard visualization. For an intuitive understanding, the analysis is visualized using various methods including bar charts, heat maps, pie charts, histograms, scatter plots, line graphs, box plots, and stacked bar charts.
- Other libraries and tools can be added here as you use them.

## Getting Started

Clone this repository to your local machine.
(Optional) Set up a virtual environment and install the necessary Python libraries listed in the requirements.txt file.
Navigate to the desired directory (e.g., data_cleaning, exploratory_data_analysis) and open the Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts.
Follow the instructions within the notebooks/scripts to run the code.

## Data

The dataset used in this project is confidential and not included in this repository. If you are authorized and need access to the dataset, please get in touch with the NHSA administration for access instructions. You can still review the code and the documentation without the dataset.

Due to the sensitive nature of the data, which may include personal information, ensuring compliance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) is imperative. FERPA is a federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. As such, access to the dataset is restricted to protect the privacy and rights of the individuals involved. Only authorized individuals with a legitimate educational interest are granted access, subject to strict guidelines and protocols. This ensures that the dataset is handled responsibly and in accordance with legal requirements and ethical considerations.
