# National Head Start Association Parent Gauge Data Analysis

This repository contains the code and documentation for conducting a comprehensive data analysis of interviews collected through the Parent Gauge tool by the National Head Start Association (NHSA). The analysis aims to understand and gain insights into the experiences of parents who have participated in Head Start programs.

## Overview

The NHSAâ€™s Parent Gauge tool has collected a rich dataset through years of interviews with parents. This dataset includes both quantitative and qualitative information ranging from survey responses to open-ended interview questions. This project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and advanced analytical techniques to derive meaningful insights from the data.

## Repository Structure

- data_cleaning/: Directory containing scripts and notebooks used for cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
exploratory_data_analysis/: Directory containing scripts and notebooks used for exploratory data analysis.
- advanced_analysis/: Directory containing scripts and notebooks that apply advanced analytical techniques such as natural language processing and machine learning.
- .gitignore: A file containing patterns that match files or directories that Git should ignore.
- README.md: The file you are currently reading.
- Note: The actual dataset is not included in this repository for privacy and security reasons.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- Python: The main programming language used for data analysis.
- Pandas: A powerful Python data analysis library.
- Jupyter Notebook: An open-source application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.
- Other libraries and tools can be added here as you use them.
